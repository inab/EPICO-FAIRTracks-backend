# DESCRIPTION

EPICO::REST::Backend::FAIRTracks is the FAIRTracks backend, built for
the ELIXIR Implementation Study "FAIRification of Genomic Data Tracks".

# RATIONALE

Instead of having a monolithic API, EPICO REST API was designed thinking
both on different instances of the same implementation, as well as pluggable
instances for other external sources.
